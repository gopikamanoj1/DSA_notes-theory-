.what is load factor---------------------------------------------------------------------


Load factor is a measure used to determine the fullness or occupancy of a hashtable or hash-based data structure. 
It represents the ratio of the number of elements (or entries) currently stored in the hashtable to the total number 
of slots (or buckets) available in the hashtable.

The load factor is calculated using the formula:

Load Factor = Number of Elements / Total Number of Slots

For example, if a hashtable has 50 elements stored in it and has a total of 100 slots available, the load factor would be 50/100 = 0.5.

The load factor provides information about how much of the hashtable's capacity is being utilized. It indicates how "full" 
the hashtable is and can be used as a measure of its efficiency.

A high load factor (closer to 1) indicates that the hashtable is approaching its capacity or becoming full. This can lead to 
an increased number of collisions, resulting in reduced performance and slower lookup times. In such cases, it may be necessary
 to resize the hashtable by increasing the number of slots to maintain an acceptable load factor and improve performance.

On the other hand, a low load factor (closer to 0) suggests that the hashtable has a lot of unused or empty slots. This can 
result in inefficient use of memory and wasted space. In such cases, the hashtable may benefit from resizing or rehashing to 
reduce the number of empty slots and improve memory utilization.

Choosing an optimal load factor depends on the specific requirements of the application and the trade-off between memory usage
 and performance. A commonly recommended load factor is around 0.7 to 0.8, as it provides a good balance between memory
  utilization and performance.

Monitoring and managing the load factor is essential to ensure the efficient operation of hashtables and to maintain optimal 
performance in hash-based data structures.
