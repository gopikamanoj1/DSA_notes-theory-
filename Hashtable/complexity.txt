.complexity of hashtable-------------------------------------------------------

The time complexity of hashtable operations depends on several factors, including the specific
 implementation and the quality of the hash function used. In general, the average-case time
  complexity of hashtable operations is O(1), which means they can be performed in constant time on average.

Here are the time complexities for common hashtable operations:

1. **Insertion (Put)**: O(1) average-case time complexity. The hash function determines 
the index where the key-value pair is stored, and the insertion can be done in constant 
time if there are no collisions.

2. **Retrieval (Get)**: O(1) average-case time complexity. The hash function is used to 
locate the index of the key in the hashtable, and the value can be retrieved in constant 
time if there are no collisions.

3. **Deletion (Remove)**: O(1) average-case time complexity. Similar to retrieval, the hash
 function is used to locate the index of the key, and the key-value pair can be removed in 
 constant time if there are no collisions.

However, it's important to note that in the worst case, when there are many collisions, the time 
complexity can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the hashtable. This worst-case
 scenario occurs when all elements hash to the same index and form long chains or lists, 
 requiring a linear search within each chain.

To mitigate collisions and maintain efficient performance, various collision resolution techniques like
 chaining (using linked lists or other data structures) or open addressing (probing sequences like
  linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing) can be employed. These techniques aim to 
  distribute the elements more evenly and reduce the likelihood of collisions.

In terms of space complexity, hashtables typically have a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number
 of elements stored in the hashtable. This accounts for the space required to store the key-value pairs
  and any additional data structures used for collision resolution.

Overall, hashtables provide efficient average-case performance for insertion, retrieval, and deletion
 operations, making them a popular choice for implementing associative arrays or dictionaries in various programming scenarios.
