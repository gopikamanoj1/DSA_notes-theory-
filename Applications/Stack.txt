Stack:
1. **Undo/Redo Operations**: Stacks are used in applications to implement the undo/redo functionality. 
Each operation is pushed onto the stack, allowing users to revert or redo actions in a sequential manner.

2. **Expression Evaluation**: Stacks are used in programming languages and calculators to evaluate arithmetic expressions.
 The stack helps in evaluating the expression in the correct order, considering operators and parentheses.

3. **Function Call Stack**: Stacks are used in programming languages to manage function calls. When a function is called, 
its execution context is pushed onto the stack, and when the function completes, the context is popped from the stack
 to resume execution at the calling point.
