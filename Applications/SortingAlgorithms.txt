Sorting Algorithms:
1. **Database Sorting**: Sorting algorithms are used in database systems to order query results or to build indexes.
 Efficient sorting algorithms such as Quicksort, Mergesort, or Heapsort are employed to process large volumes of data effectively.

2. **Online Marketplace**: Sorting algorithms are used in online marketplaces to sort products based on different 
criteria such as price, popularity, or ratings. Users can easily find and compare products in the desired order.

3. **Music and Video Streaming**: Sorting algorithms are utilized in music and video streaming platforms to create
 personalized playlists or recommend content based on user preferences and viewing history.

4. **Flight Scheduling**: Sorting algorithms are employed in airline systems to optimize flight schedules based on departure time, 
arrival time, or other criteria. This helps to minimize delays, improve efficiency, and provide a better travel experience.
