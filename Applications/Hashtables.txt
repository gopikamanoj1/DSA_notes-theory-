Hashtables:
1. **Phonebook**: Hashtables are commonly used in phonebook applications to store contact information. 
The hash function maps names or phone numbers to their respective locations in the hashtable, allowing
 for efficient lookup and retrieval of contact details.

2. **Caching**: Hashtables are used in caching systems to store frequently accessed data, 
such as web page content or database query results. The hashtable allows for fast lookup and
 retrieval of cached data, improving overall system performance.

3. **Spell Checkers**: Hashtables are used in spell checkers to store a dictionary of valid words. 
The hashtable allows for quick lookup of words to check their spelling and provide suggestions for misspelled words.

4. **Compiler Symbol Tables**: Hashtables are used in compilers and interpreters to store information
 about identifiers (variables, functions, etc.) and their associated attributes. The hashtable facilitates 
 efficient lookup and retrieval of symbols during the compilation or interpretation process.
